Revitalizing this old project.

# Cucumber Dashboard

## Goal
To provide a solution for running Cucumber in parallel, recording and presenting the results.

## Initial Design
Library will consist of an API and some sort of a web front end. 
One-two other projects will be added to support the queue functionality for parallelizing Cucumber runs.

## Utilized Technologies
Hanami (https://github.com/hanami/hanami)
MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)

My hopes is that this will be simple enough that could share around or act as an example for those considering ways of solving similar problems.
